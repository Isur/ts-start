# Deploy

App is builded into `./dist` directory.

There is also `Dockerfile` and `docker-compose.yml` files.

Docker compose will spin app up, just remember about `.env` file.

# Dependencies

This starter is using `tsc` and `tsc-alias` for compiling app. To run hot reload development there is `nodemon` watching generated `.js` files, and `concurrently` to run together compiler and app.

For static code checking there is `eslint` with plugins and `prettier`.

Testing is done with `jest`.

Environment config is loaded with `dotenv` and `dotenv-expand`.

For schema validation `zod` is used.
